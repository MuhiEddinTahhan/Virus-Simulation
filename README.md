Virus simulation that showcases implementations of design patterns
The Malware Simulation Program is designed to emulate various types of malware actions for educational purposes. It uses a structured approach to simulate actions such as scanning for hosts, sending phishing emails, establishing connections, dumping system files, cracking passwords, and deleting logs. The program is implemented in Java and extends a base class “Unit” to represent each type of malware as an object.

The program initializes the following:

The MalwareUnit has a method that helps enumerate through actions like scanning, sending emails, etc. Each MalwareUnit created has one role to do:
